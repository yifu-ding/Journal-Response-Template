	- A summary of the practical domains where these methods have been applied, or could be applied, is missing.

	Thank you for the pertinent suggestions. We agree with your point of view. We added an application section (Section VIII) on the 18th page of the revised manuscript. For your convenience, we put the newly added application section below, and we hope it will satisfy you.
