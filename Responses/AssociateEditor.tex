Thank you very much for your valuable comments and suggestions. Our initial manuscript included no experiments because we followed other high-quality surveys \cite{wu2020comprehensive,ji2021survey,li2021survey,zhang2023survey,li2021low} that did not include experiments. However, in light of your valuable feedback, we conducted some necessary experiments to provide better guidelines and insights to the readership. In the revised manuscript, we added a new section (Section VII on the 17th page of the revised manuscript) dedicated to comparative experiments, and we anonymously open-sourced the code implementing all experiments. For your convenience, we have restated the experimental part of the revised manuscript below.
