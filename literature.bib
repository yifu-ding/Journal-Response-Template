	abstract="Long-tailed distributions and class imbalance are problems of significant importance in applied deep learning where trained models are exploited for decision support and decision automation in critical areas such as health and medicine, transportation and finance. The challenge of learning deep models from such data remains high, and the state-of-the-art solutions are typically data dependent and primarily focused on images. Important real-world problems, however, are much more diverse thus necessitating a general solution that can be applied to diverse data types. In this paper, we propose ReMix, a training technique that seamlessly leverages batch resampling, instance mixing and soft-labels to efficiently enable the induction of robust deep models from imbalanced and long-tailed datasets. Our results show that fully connected neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained with ReMix generally outperform the alternatives according to the g-mean and are better calibrated according to the balanced Brier score.",

	abstract = 	 {Probabilistic classifiers output a probability distribution on target classes rather than just a class prediction. Besides providing a clear separation of prediction and decision making, the main advantage of probabilistic models is their ability to represent uncertainty about predictions. In safety-critical applications, it is pivotal for a model to possess an adequate sense of uncertainty, which for probabilistic classifiers translates into outputting probability distributions that are consistent with the empirical frequencies observed from realized outcomes. A classifier with such a property is called calibrated. In this work, we develop a general theoretical calibration evaluation framework grounded in probability theory, and point out subtleties present in model calibration evaluation that lead to refined interpretations of existing evaluation techniques. Lastly, we propose new ways to quantify and visualize miscalibration in probabilistic classification, including novel multidimensional reliability diagrams.}

	abstractNote={ &lt;p&gt; Learning probabilistic predictive models that are well calibrated is critical for many prediction and decision-making tasks in artificial intelligence. In this paper we present a new non-parametric calibration method called Bayesian Binning into Quantiles (BBQ) which addresses key limitations of existing calibration methods. The method post processes the output of a binary classification algorithm; thus, it can be readily combined with many existing classification algorithms. The method is computationally tractable, and empirically accurate, as evidenced by the set of experiments reported here on both real and simulated datasets. &lt;/p&gt; },

	abstractNote={It is now well known that neural networks can be wrong with high confidence in their predictions, leading to poor calibration. The most common post-hoc approach to compensate for this is to perform temperature scaling, which adjusts the confidences of the predictions on any input by scaling the logits by a fixed value. Whilst this approach typically improves the average calibration across the whole test dataset, this improvement typically reduces the individual confidences of the predictions irrespective of whether the classification of a given input is correct or incorrect. With this insight, we base our method on the observation that different samples contribute to the calibration error by varying amounts, with some needing to increase their confidence and others needing to decrease it. Therefore, for each input, we propose to predict a different temperature value, allowing us to adjust the mismatch between confidence and accuracy at a finer granularity. Our method is applied post-hoc, enabling it to be very fast with a negligible memory footprint and is applied to off-the-shelf pre-trained classifiers. We test our method on the ResNet50 and WideResNet28-10 architectures using the CIFAR10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, showing that producing per-data-point temperatures improves the expected calibration error across the whole test set.},

	abstract = {Class membership probability estimates are important for many applications of data mining in which classification outputs are combined with other sources of information for decision-making, such as example-dependent misclassification costs, the outputs of other classifiers, or domain knowledge. Previous calibration methods apply only to two-class problems. Here, we show how to obtain accurate probability estimates for multiclass problems by combining calibrated binary probability estimates. We also propose a new method for obtaining calibrated two-class probability estimates that can be applied to any classifier that produces a ranking of examples. Using naive Bayes and support vector machine classifiers, we give experimental results from a variety of two-class and multiclass domains, including direct marketing, text categorization and digit recognition.},
